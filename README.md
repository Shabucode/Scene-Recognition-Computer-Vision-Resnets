Scene Recognition with ResNet34

This project focuses on scene recognition using the ResNet34 architecture, a powerful deep learning model known for its efficiency and accuracy. Scene recognition is a vital task in computer vision, enabling applications such as image search, content moderation, and augmented reality.

The project utilizes a carefully curated dataset of labeled images containing a diverse range of scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, urban and rural landscapes, and various natural and man-made settings. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation.

Our approach involves fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet34 model on the labeled image dataset to extract meaningful features from the input images and classify them into predefined categories.

The trained ResNet34 model achieves high accuracy and robustness in scene recognition across a wide range of scene categories. Experimental results and performance metrics are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
